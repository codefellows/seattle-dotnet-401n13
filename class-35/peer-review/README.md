1. Write a peer review on your partner's code. Review a few of the different user stories your partner has completed and take what you learned from the above to formulate and share a peer review of your partner's work. (15 points)

## Peer Review Requirements
When creating your peer review for your partner, include the following:
1. The user story you are reviewing. (be specific)
1. Is the code readable? If so, why? If not, how can you make it readable?
1. Describe the implementation. 
	- What is the code doing? 
	- Describe the input/output of the requests
	- Why is this code important/needed
1. Do you see any bugs/issues within the code?
1. What did you like about the implementation? Please elaborate on why. 
1. Would you suggest anything to be done differently? How would you refactor?

Review the list below of the user stories you can conduct a review on:

#### Developer 1
Developer 1 can review any of the following user stories that Developer 2 completed:
1. View Component of the "Mini Basket"
1. Application Roles seeded into the Database
1. Order Receipt page

#### Developer 2
Developer 2 can review any of the following user stories that Developer 1 completed:
1. Designated Basket Page
1. Product Landing Page (View all the product details)
1. Emailed Receipt of purchases

### Expectations

When writing out your peer review, refrain from writing a review that is short and simple. Choose any of the three choices you have that will be the most beneficial. Comments like "IDk, it looks fine" or anything along those lines making it apparent that a genuine or healthy attempt was not made will not be accepted, and a zero will be given. Practice communication and elaboration on reviews to gain the full benefit of the purpose of reviews. If you don't have any critical feedback for the code, look at the other user stories. If you agree with the code...why? what do you like about it? if you disagree with the code, share with us how you think it could be improved.

***Peer reviews are expected to be at least 2 paragraphs minimum.*** A paragraph is considered at 3-5 sentences. Low quality peer reviews will be given a low quality grade. Peer Reviews are not accepted for resubmits.
