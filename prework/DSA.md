# Data Structures and Algorithms

Data Structures and Algorithms (often referred to as DSA) is a huge principle in computer science fundamentals. Everyday
in the course you will be given a new coding challenge and will be required to white board out the solution as well as implement a code
solution with Visual Studio. *For the prework, you only have to implement a solution, a white board is not required*.

## Instructions
Complete the readings for Big O. Once completed, complete the 4 coding challenges. Each coding challenge will not only help you
practice the C# language, it is also an opportunity to practice problem solving and approaching interview like challenges.

**It is recommended that you complete the code/lab portion of the prework before starting the code challenges**. This is because the code/lab portion
of the prework contains links and technical resources to learn and understand the c# language.

### Coding Challenges

Utilize what you learned in the [Tutorials](prework-tutorials.md){:target="_blank"} prework and apply them to coding challenges.

## Submitting Your Work
To submit your code challenges, create a new repository in your personal GitHub named `Prework-CodeChallenges`.

Within this repo, have the challenge sln, and project files. Please have each challenge as a separate method in the **Program.cs** file.

### Guidance
1. Create a new GH repo
2. Clone it to your local machine
3. Create a new Visual Studio Console Application project
3. Save the project into this new repository located on your local machine.
5. Commit and push changes appropriately.
6. Make a new branch for each challenge.
7. Create a PR for each challenge back to main.
