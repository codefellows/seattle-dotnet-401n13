# Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week. 

Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn't be a problem. It's important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group.

## Planning

Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team.

Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement. 
  
## Deliverable

Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission.

### Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?
- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?
- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength? 
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

### Conflict Plan 

Your team should agree on a process for handing disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

- What will be your group's process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute? 
- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- What hours will you be available to communicate?
- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone ...)?
- How often will you take breaks?
- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voice is heard?
- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems. This should prevent "lone wolf" efforts and "siloed" efforts. 

Describe at least:

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? 
- What project management tool will be used? 

### Git Process

Plan out what your team's Git workflow looks like for coding tasks. 

Describe at least:

- What components of your project will live on GitHub? 
- How will you share the repository with your teammates?
- What is your Git flow? 
- Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:
  - How many people must review a PR? 
  - Who merges PRs? 
  - How often will you merge? 
  - How will you communicate that it's time to merge?

## Submitting Your Work

This is a group submission. Only one person must submit for group credit.

Please have everyone's name at the top of the doc. 

Submit a link to your the GitHub markdown file where you have created your Team Agreement.

This step must be completed and approved before proceeding with any project work. Notify your instructor when this is ready for review.
