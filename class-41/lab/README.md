# Lab: Unity

Welcome to game development!

## Overview

Conceptualize your game and lay the groundwork for development

There are no rules here ... build any type of game you wish. But remember, you've only got 4 lab sessions to complete it, so focus on basic game play and scope your design accordingly.

Most of all, have fun with the process and get comfortable in the Unity environment.

You will have 4 lab sessions to complete your work.
